Headings:

headings are html elements used as the main headlines in the document structure
headings are important in your page as search engines always deals with headings 
users always get benefit of headings for document consistency
use headings for only titles and headlines not to make text larger
we use from <h1>to<h6> to markup headings from most important to 
least important respectively
you can specify and customize the size of heading using inline css styling
example <h1> i am heading 1</h1>
try this and change 1 to any number up to six and see the diffrence


Paragraphs:
html have a <p> element which start a new line of text with special margins 
the paragraph removes any extra spaces and newlines unless we use the forollowing
        
        a) add new line
                -use the markup <br> to searchtart newline 
                example : 
                            <p>we will start <br> newline   </p>


        b)add horizontal line
                - use <hr> to draw horizontal line
                - <p>line one</p>
                 <hr> 
                 <p> line 2 </p>

for special type of texts as poems we can use <pre> to preserve
the spaces and newlines

example:
        <pre>
            we wish you a merry christmas 
            and a happy new year
        </pre>



Formatting:

Html have several tags for giving texts special styling and meanings as italics 
where

<b>:used to bold the text between tags 
<strong>: same as bold and gives text an importance
<i>:used to make text betwwen tags italics
<em>:same as italic but used for readers to mention this text as emphasized
<mark>:make text highlighted
<ins> make text underlined
<del> make text striked out
<sup> make text superscripted
<sub> make text subscipted

example:
            <p>this text is <b> bolded </b>   </p>

try this and change <b> with diffrent formatting tags
